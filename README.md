# Machine Learning Approaches for Power Grid Load Forecasting  
Student: Omar Abdesslem  
Institution: University of Geneva  

# Overview  
The project focuses on using advanced ML techniques for load prediction, which will be compared against traditional forecasting approaches to improve short-term and long-term prediction accuracy. Key factors like weather conditions and seasonal trends are integrated into the forecasting process to enhance model performance.
